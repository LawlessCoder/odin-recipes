# odin-recipes

My first website from The Odin Project that was built using HTML and CSS.

## Overview

The goal of this project was to become familiar with the basics of HTML and utilize some of the lessons I have learned about CSS to style the content. I was not concerned with providing real content for the site. Instead, I was focused on overall structure and style. 

## What I Learned

Some of the main ideas I learned from this project were how to structure a web-based repository and how to utilize multiple stylesheets.

## Areas for Improvement

If I were to do this project again, I would focus more on creating a consistent style across the recipe pages. I noticed that depending on the amount of text in a section, the recipe card may appear vertically loaded or disengaging.
